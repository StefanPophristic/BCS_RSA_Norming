# BCS_RSA_Norming

## General Information

This is a norming study for the stimuli which will be used in Stefan Pophristic's
and Judith Degen's cross linguistic reference project in BCS (Serbo-Croatian). We
created a set of 105 stimuli images, each occurring in four different colors
(blue, red, yellow, white or purple, green, orange, black). In the two experiments
we allow participants to label the object or the objects color however they wish.
Based on consistency of naming conventions (of both the objects and their colors),
we will choose which stimuli provide good testing ground for the cross linguistic project.

## Experiments
### Experiment 1: Noun Norming
We show the 105 images, and for each image we ask "Kako se zove ovaj objekat?"
(what is this object called?). Each participant is shown all 105 unique objects
in a randomized order. The color of each object is chosen at random at the start
of the experiment. Therefore each participant sees every unique object once and
only in one color.

### Experiment 2: Color Norming
The experiment is identical to experiment 1, except we ask "Koje je boje ovaj objekat?"
(what color is this object?).
